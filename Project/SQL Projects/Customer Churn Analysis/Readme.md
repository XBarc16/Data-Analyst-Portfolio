# Customer Churn Analysis

Project Overview & Objectives

Business Problem/Objective:

Analyze customer churn to understand why customers leave and identify ways to reduce churn rates.
Track churn based on demographics, contract types, payment methods, internet service usage, and geographic factors.

Key Questions:

What is the total churn rate, and how does it vary by different factors?
Which customer segments (gender, age, tenure) have the highest churn rates?
How does contract type or payment method impact churn?
Which states have the highest churn rates?
What services are associated with higher customer retention or churn?

Stakeholders:

Customer Success Teams – Identify patterns to improve retention.
Marketing & Sales Teams – Target high-risk customers with retention offers.
Finance Team – Assess churn impact on revenue and forecast losses.
Executive Leadership – Use insights for strategic decision-making.

2. Data Collection Requirements

Data Sources:

Internal databases (customer CRM, billing systems, transaction history).
Customer feedback & surveys (churn reasons like competition, dissatisfaction).

Data Format:

Structured: Excel, CSV, SQL (customer records, transactions, churn logs).

Data Volume & Frequency:

Historical and real-time data for 6,418 customers.
Regularly updated churn metrics.

Data Access & Permissions:

Requires access to customer databases for analytics.

Missing or Incomplete Data Handling:

Possible strategies:
Imputation for missing values.
Filtering out incomplete records.

Data Cleaning & Preparation

Handling Missing Values:

Ensure churn labels, contract details, and payment methods are not missing.

Removing Duplicates:

Verify unique customer records in the dataset.

Correcting Data Types:

Ensure numerical values for churn rates and categorical labels for contract types.

Standardizing Data:

Convert tenure into a consistent format (months/years).
Standardize churn categories (Competition, Attitude, Dissatisfaction, etc.).

Detecting Outliers:

Check extreme values (e.g., very high churn in certain demographics).

Data Transformation & Processing

Data Aggregation:

Churn rates are aggregated by gender, age, payment method, contract type, and state.

Feature Engineering:

Derived metrics like Churn Rate % per Segment.

Normalization/Scaling:

Values are displayed as percentages for comparison.

Data Merging & Integration:

Integrated customer demographics, service usage, and churn status for deeper insights.

Data Security & Compliance

Data Privacy Considerations:

No personally identifiable customer information is shown in the dashboard.

Regulatory Compliance:

Ensure compliance with GDPR, CCPA, and company policies.

Data Encryption & Security:

If using cloud databases, ensure encryption for security.

Backup & Recovery Plan:

Maintain regular backups of customer churn data.

6. Data Analysis & Modeling Requirements

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Analyze patterns in churn rates across different factors.
Identify correlations between churn and payment methods, contract types, and tenure.

Statistical Methods:

Comparative Analysis: Churn rates by demographics and services.
Trend Analysis: How churn changes over time.

Machine Learning Models (if applicable):

Could use predictive modeling (e.g., logistic regression) to forecast churn.

Business Metrics & KPIs:

Total Customers: 6,418
Total Churn: 1,732
Churn Rate: 27.0%
Highest Churn Demographics & Services

Data Visualization & Reporting

Visualization Tools:

Power BI (used in the dashboard).

Report Format:

Interactive Dashboard with filters (monthly charge range, marital status).

Target Audience:

Business & operations teams, including executives.

Interactivity Needs:

Users can filter by charge range, tenure, internet type, and region.

Interpretation & Insights Presentation

Key Findings:

Overall churn rate is 27.0%.
Higher churn in Jammu (57.2%) and Assam (38.1%).
Month-to-month contracts have the highest churn (46.5%).
Mailed check payments have the highest churn (37.8%), while credit card users churn less (14.8%).
Fiber optic users churn the most (41.1%).
Customers without security and backup services churn more.

Actionable Recommendations:

Target high-risk customers (month-to-month, fiber optic users) with retention strategies.
Offer discounts or incentives for long-term contracts.
Improve customer service in high-churn states (Jammu, Assam).
Encourage credit card payments to reduce churn.

Limitations & Assumptions:

Data might not include external reasons for churn (market trends, competition).
Possible sampling bias if data does not represent the entire customer base.

Next Steps & Future Work:

Predictive modeling to forecast future churn risks.
A/B testing different retention strategies.
Expand dataset to include customer feedback and complaints.
