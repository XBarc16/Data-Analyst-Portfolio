Project Overview & Objectives

Business Problem/Objective:

The objective is to track and analyze sales performance across different dimensions, such as customer location, product category, and time (year/month).
Identify trends in total sales, budget performance, and top-selling products/customers.

Key Questions:

What is the total budget and sales performance over time?
Which products and categories contribute the most to revenue?
Who are the top customers driving sales?
How do sales vary by location?

Stakeholders:

Sales Managers – Track sales targets and budget performance.
Marketing Team – Identify popular products and customer trends.
Finance Department – Monitor revenue trends and budget utilization.
Executives/Leadership – Make strategic decisions based on sales insights.

Data Collection Requirements

Data Sources:

Internal sales databases (CRM, ERP).
External market data for benchmarking.
Customer transaction history.

Data Format:

Structured: Excel, CSV, SQL (sales records, product categories, customer transactions).

Data Volume & Frequency:

Historical Data (2019–2024) is included.
Data is likely collected daily/monthly to track trends.

Data Access & Permissions:

Requires access to company databases for real-time or batch data extraction.

Missing or Incomplete Data Handling:

Approaches may include:
Filling missing values with averages or estimates.
Filtering out incomplete records.

Data Cleaning & Preparation

Handling Missing Values:

If sales data is missing, it can be imputed or flagged for correction.

Removing Duplicates:

Ensure no duplicate transactions in the dataset.

Correcting Data Types:

Ensure sales figures are numeric and dates are in standard formats (YYYY-MM-DD).

Standardizing Data:

Product names and customer names should be consistent.
Sales figures should be in the same currency/unit.

Detecting Outliers:

Identify abnormal sales spikes that may indicate data entry errors.

Data Transformation & Processing

Data Aggregation:

Sales data is aggregated by month, category, and customer.

Feature Engineering:

Created metrics like Total Budget, Total Sales, and Sales Growth.

Normalization/Scaling:

Sales values are formatted in millions (M) for better readability.

Data Merging & Integration:

Sales data is combined with customer and product data for deeper insights.

Data Security & Compliance

Data Privacy Considerations:

Customer names are partially masked (e.g., "Jordan T.").

Regulatory Compliance:

The dashboard should comply with GDPR, CCPA, and company policies.

Data Encryption & Security:

If this data is stored in a cloud database, encryption should be applied.

Backup & Recovery Plan:

Sales data should be backed up regularly to prevent loss.

Data Analysis & Modeling Requirements

Trends in total sales & budget performance over time.
Best-selling products & top customers.
Sales distribution by city & category.
